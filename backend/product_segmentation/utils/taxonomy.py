"""Utility helpers for working with product taxonomies.

These functions are minimal *Python*-only implementations that enable the
``DatabaseProductSegmentationService`` to perform a *best-effort* consolidation
step when no advanced LLM support is available.  The logic purposefully keeps
state handling simple and deterministic so that it can be unit-tested without
external services.
