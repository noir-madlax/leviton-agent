I can never get the product fully out of my hair, it leaves a greasy looking crunchy look when dry. Yes the product suggest rinsing for 15 minutes, but that's way too long for me to find worth it. Yet, I have tried that. I have run my fingers through and tried really hard to get it all out. But it never has. Plus, my hair texture hasn't improved, its not shiny, nor grown thicker... so I say save your money",

My scalp felt dry and itchy, but this oil is incredibly nourishing. The texture is rich but not greasy, and it absorbs beautifully into the scalp and hair. I use the dropper to apply the oil directly to my roots, then massage it in with the scalp massager—total game-changer! It makes my hair care routine feel like a relaxing self-care moment. The natural scent is refreshing, and my hair feels softer, looks shinier, and the ends are noticeably less dry. Highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with dryness, irritation, or weak hair. Excellent quality for the price!",

I don't remember to use it as consistently as I want but even once a week makes a difference. I don't sleep in it so I put it in my hair during the day on hair wash day and then wash in the shower that night. I love this stuff! Purchasing my second bottle now.",

I used it before washing and massaged it in with the little scalp brush it came with that thing feels awesome! and I think it helped loosen up buildup too. My scalp feels golden after a few uses My curls have been looking softer and more hydrated and my ends don’t feel as rough. Definitely noticed a difference. Posting before and after pics also",

      "text": "Okay, I haven’t been using this long enough to speak to major results yet, but I wanted to share my initial thoughts because I know sometimes the first impression is what makes or breaks whether something stays in your routine. The oil itself is lovely—really nice texture, not too thick or greasy, and the scent is honestly so good. It has that natural, herbal smell that feels spa-like without being overpowering. Application was super easy, and I appreciate that it doesn’t drip all over or make my hair feel heavy. The scalp massager is slightly different from what’s pictured, but it’s still really nice to use. It gives a good amount of pressure without being too harsh, and paired with the oil, it turns the whole thing into a mini self-care moment. Obviously, I’ll need more time to see if it helps with growth or thickness, but so far it’s been a great addition to my nighttime routine. If you’re in that “trying to take better care of my scalp without going full wellness influencer” phase like I am, this is a solid start.",
