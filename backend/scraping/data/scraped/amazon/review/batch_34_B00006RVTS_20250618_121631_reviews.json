      "text": "The crayons themselves are great—just what you’d expect from Crayola. They have vibrant color, strong tips, and a smooth texture that works well for both kids and adults. The quality is definitely there. However, I was really surprised and a bit disappointed that the packaging arrived damaged. For a trusted brand, I expected better care in the shipping or packaging process. Thankfully, the crayons inside were intact and usable. If you're looking for reliable, high-quality crayons, these are a solid choice—but I hope future orders come in better condition.",

Like the pencils were having trouble fitting in it, which was odd. After taking them out, then trying unsuccessfully to return them to the box, I realized why. A bunch of them are warped. Slight curves and bends throughout. Isn’t noticeable when they’re sitting in a pencil cup. And still work just fine. But won’t be keeping them in the box for storage as I normally would, as they don’t fit. Keeping for the grandkids. But shall be buying myself another set (locally) that I can keep in the box so it can stay with my other to-go office supplies. And not sit in a pencil holder on my desk.",

They offer vibrant colors that blend beautifully, allowing for smooth gradients and detailed shading. Whether you’re using wax-based, oil-based, or watercolor pencils, they provide endless creative possibilities. I love how portable and easy to use they are perfect for sketching on the go or creating intricate artwork at home. Plus, they’re available in a wide range of sets, from basic to professional grade, so there’s something for everyone. Highly recommend for anyone looking to explore their artistic side!",
